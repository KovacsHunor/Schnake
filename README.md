# Schnake

## About
It's Snake but the sides are portals.

## Controls
You can use WASD or Arrow buttons to control the snake, and mouse to navigate through the menu.

## Game
The game field is divided to n*n boards. Every board has 4 sides which act like portals and the color of the portal indicates which other portal it is connected to. The shape of the end of the portal indicates where you will come out from the other portal. When you try to step on yourself, you die and get to the death screen.
